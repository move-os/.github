# moveOS

The ***moveOS*** comprises of a *lightweight Kernel* with supporting libraries that greatly help in developing and deploying *movable smart-objects* covering a variety of domains. Presently, the target domains include:

  * Electric Vehicles
  * Smart carriers - ground-based, over the surface, and submerged vehicles, and flying objects
  * Robots
  * 3D printers
  * IoT and IIoT devices


&nbsp;

The main features of the OS include:

  * Lightweight deployments
  * Energy efficiency
  * Real-time responsiveness
  * Task and event-based software designs
  * Natively supporting the State Machines
  * Graphical and headless deployments
  * Remote interfacing through stand-alone graphical or cloud-based services
  * Ready-to-use security and other modules
  * Low-code or no-code capabilities
  * ROS integration
  * High configurability

## Run-time Environments

From the beginning, ***moveOS*** is intended to be deployed on bare-metal devices, Windows and Linux distributions; though, its behavior can change depending on deployed environments and underlying hardware features.
