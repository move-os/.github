# moveOS

The ***moveOS*** comprises of a *lightweight Kernel* with supporting libraries that greatly help in developing and deploying *movable smart-objects* covering a variety of domains. Presently, the target domains include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Electric Vehicles*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Smart carriers - ground-based, over the surface, and submerged vehicles, and flying objects*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *General and special-purpose robots*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *3D printers*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *IoT and IIoT devices*


&nbsp;

The main features of the OS include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Lightweight deployments*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Energy efficiency*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Real-time responsiveness*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Task and event-based software designs*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Natively supporting the State Machines*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Graphical and headless deployments*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Remote interfacing through stand-alone graphical or cloud-based services*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Ready-to-use security and other modules*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Low-code and no-code capabilities*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *ROS integration*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:saxophone:&nbsp;&nbsp; *High configurability*
